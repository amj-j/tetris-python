# Tetris

This is a version of the classsis Tetris game.
It is coded in python, using Tkinter for GUI.
I coded this back in the summer of 2021 on my own, to practice the basic principles and good practices of programming.
I wasn't aware of object oriented programming at that time, so there are no classes of my own, only top level functions.
I wasn't aware of git and github at that time, so there is only one commit, with which this project was uploaded to github months later. 

### Prerequisites
To run this game, you need to have Python Interpreter installed on your PC. (Version 3.x or later.)
If you don't have it already, download from [python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation
1. Clone this repository by typing ```git clone https://github.com/amj-j/tetris-python.git``` in git bash.
2. Run the ```main.py``` file.
